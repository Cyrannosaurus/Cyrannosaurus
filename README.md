- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cyrannosaurus
- 👀 I’m interested in computers and AI. That means hardware, programming languages low and high, learning algorithms, and rational decision making.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do statistical modelling as well as what goes on at a low level in a computer (assembly lang, verilog, and all the things that come with them)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a package for general search algoritms. 
- 📫 You can reach me on my linked in profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/conrad-wiebe-3579911b6/
